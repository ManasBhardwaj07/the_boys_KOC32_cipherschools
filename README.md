# Movie Tickets Booking Website [Group Project]
This project consists of building a responsive website for movie tickets booking. It has three responsive pages- a Homepage, booking page and an About page. All the pages have three responsive breakpoints for small, medium and large screens.
I have used CSS flexbox to make the pages responsive
